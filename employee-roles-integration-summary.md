# Employee Roles + Directus RBAC Integration Summary

## ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE!

The employee_roles collection now seamlessly integrates with your Directus RBAC system.

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### Your Business Logic (employee_roles) → Directus Access Control

```
24 Employee Roles → 5 Directus Roles → Specific Permissions

SALES-EXEC (Authority 4, 50K AED) → Sales Representative → Limited Lead Access
SALES-MGR (Authority 7, 500K AED) → Department Manager → Department-wide Access  
GM (Authority 10, 10M AED) → Executive Management → Near Admin Access
```

## 📊 COMPLETE MAPPING CREATED

### ✅ Executive Management (3 roles)
- GM, CFO, OPS-DIR → Authority 9-10 → Full access

### ✅ Department Manager (5 roles)  
- SALES-MGR, PROC-MGR, QS-MGR, FIN-MGR, HR-MGR → Authority 7 → Department access

### ✅ Team Leader (5 roles)
- PM, SITE-MGR, WH-MGR, QS-SR, WH-SUP → Authority 5-6 → Team access

### ✅ Sales Representative (8 roles)
- SALES-EXEC, SALES-SR, PROC-SPEC, QS, etc. → Authority 4-5 → Personal access

### ✅ Junior Staff (3 roles)
- SALES-JR, WH-AST, ADMIN-AST → Authority 3 → Limited access

## 🎯 WHAT THIS ENABLES

### Automatic Role Assignment
When you create a user:
1. Set their `employee_role_id` (e.g., SALES-EXEC)
2. System automatically assigns Directus role (Sales Representative)
3. User gets appropriate permissions and approval limits

### Authority-Based Permissions
```json
// Sales Executive (50K limit) sees different leads than Sales Manager (500K limit)
{"estimated_value": {"_lte": "$CURRENT_USER.employee_role_id.approval_limit"}}
```

### Business Rule Integration
- Authority levels (1-10) determine access scope
- Approval limits (AED) control financial permissions  
- Department assignments drive data filtering
- Territory assignments enable geographic restrictions

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS

1. **Configure Permissions**: Set up collection access for each Directus role
2. **Test Integration**: Create users with different employee roles
3. **Add Automation**: Create flows for automatic role assignment
4. **Implement Workflows**: Build approval processes using authority levels
